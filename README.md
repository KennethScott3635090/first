# Hello! ðŸ§ 

Hi, I'm Noah Carter, a 32-year-old AI researcher living in San Diego.

## About Me:
I've always been fascinated by artificial intelligence and its potential to transform industries. After completing my PhD in Computer Science, I now focus on developing cutting-edge AI models.

The main technologies I use:
- Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebooks for experiments
- Hugging Face for NLP tasks

## My Projects:
- **TextGenerator**: A model for generating realistic text.
- **ImageClassifier**: A deep learning model for image recognition.
- **ChatbotAI**: An intelligent chatbot system.

## What I'm Learning Now:
I'm currently exploring generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning.

## Hobbies:
When I'm not researching AI, I enjoy surfing, hiking in the San Diego hills, and playing chess.

## How to Reach Me:
If you're interested in AI research or just want to discuss machine learning, feel free to reach out!
